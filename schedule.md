## Task Breakdown by Responsibility

### **Board Assembly & Hardware Setup**
- Assemble the board  
- Determine how to connect each component by reading datasheets and pinouts  
- Identify correct operating voltages for all components  
- Determine required resistors to achieve target voltages  

---

### **Tone Detection & Signal Processing**
- Detect the correct tone from the guitar string  
- Read microphone input into the Circuit Playground  
- Detect which pitch the user is attempting to tune to  
- Determine whether the current pitch is sharp or flat  
- Communicate pitch information via Serial Port to a laptop as an initial proof of concept  
- Final goal: display pitch information directly on the OLED  

---

### **Display / UI Development (OLED)**
**Edy**

- Program and manage the OLED display  
- Display the detected pitch  
- Use color to indicate how close the tone is to being in tune  
- Show battery life status  

---

### **Motorized Tuning System**
**Gerson & Charlie**

- Automatically turn the motor based on detected pitch (Gerson)  
- Synchronize motor movement to the relative pitch of each string  
- Design a method to activate the motor  
  - Holding a button  
  - Automatic activation via microphone input  

---

### **Testing & Validation**
**Charlie**

- Bring a guitar and a commercial tuner for reference  
- Verify pitch accuracy against a known-good tuner  
- Test accuracy across different pitch ranges  
  - Lower strings  
  - Higher strings
