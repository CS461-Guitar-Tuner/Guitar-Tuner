# Team Work Schedule 

Week 8: Wait for materials to arrive, preemptively read datasheets, assemble the board. 
Week 9 & 10: Detect the correct tone, have a fully functional display, make the motor turn the tuning peg. Occasional check-ins to ensure that everything is going smoothly.
Week 11: Test and debug.
Week 12: Prepare demo, write report, prepare presentation
Who in your team is going to tackle what (tasks)?
Assemble the board 
Figure out how to connect each part by reading datasheets and pinouts
Determine the correct voltages that all components need
Determine which resistors are needed where to achieve each target voltage
Detect the correct tone
Microphone reads in signal to circuit playground
Get the circuit playground to detect which pitch the user is trying to tune to 
Have the circuit playground determine if current pitch is low or flat
Have the circuit playground communicate this with serialport on laptop for initial proof of concept, with final goal being a read-out on the display 
Have a fully functional display 
Edy will focus on tackling UI stuff and consequently take care of programming stuff for the OLED display.
Add color to show how close the tone is
Show battery life
Shows the pitch
Having an motor tuning system 

Getting the motor to turn automatically based on pitch (Gerson)
Gerson and Charlie will sync the motor to the relative pitch of the strings
Figure out a way to turn on the motor (by holding button or directly through the mic)

Testing
Charlie is going to bring his guitar and a different tuner with him in order to detect if the pitch is correct
Test pitch accuracy across different pitches (does it do well for higher or lower pitches?)
