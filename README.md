# Guitar-Tuner
This is the code for our guitar tuner. It can automatically tune a guitar automatically based on which pitch you wish it to be. In addition there is a mode to manually test if the string is in pitch.

This is a makeshift design and thus it is quite costly. This was done more in an attempt to learn how to create a product rather than be efficient.
