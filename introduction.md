##Intro##
The goal is to build a guitar tuner. It will have to sense the vibrations of the instrument and through a ui provide feedback on how the guitar player should tune the string, higher or lower. Additionally, we also think it would be cool if it mechanically twisted the tuning knob to tune it or if it emitted a ‘target tone’ to guide the individual tuning the guitar. 
Why (motivation)?
As musicians we wanted an idea that incorporated music with computer science. We believed that a guitar tuner was the project for the job. We want something that can be used in daily life and is small and compact.

What is the general approach that you are planning to take?
We will make a tuner that will help you tune with three different modes. The first mode will involve a SuperSnark type tuning approach (How To Tune Your Guitar With a Snark Tuner (Clip On Tuner) for Beginners   ) where the tuner detects pitch then a display informs the tuner as to whether it’s flat or sharp, and then notifies the tuner when it is the correct pitch. The second mode would detect the pitch and then depending on what string you are tuning it will power a motor that twists the tuning knob. A third knob would involve it detecting the pitch and then playing from a speaker the pitch of the target note.
