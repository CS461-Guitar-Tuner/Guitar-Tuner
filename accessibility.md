## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was an important consideration in the design of this project. In addition to visual feedback on the display, the tuner provides audio cues to assist users who may be visually impaired. With this being said, due to the data restrictions that we encountered while coding, we were not able to use multiple fonts. The font at the current moment isn't able to change and thus it is quite small which might prove difficult for those with bad eye sight. To make up for this in particular, the reference tone mode allows users to tune their instrument by ear without relying on the screen. 

The motor-assisted tuning feature would theoretically supports users with limited fine motor control by reducing the need for precise manual adjustments of the tuning pegs. By automating small tuning movements, the device can help make the tuning process more accessible and less physically demanding. With it's current implementation the motor itself is too weak to fully tune the guitar. In the future it is likely a different motor can be used in order to fully rotate the dials on the strings.

Together, these features aim to make the tuner usable by a wider range of players with varying sensory and motor abilities.
