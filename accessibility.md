## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was an important consideration in the design of this project. In addition to visual feedback on the display, the tuner provides audio cues to assist users who may be visually impaired. In particular, the reference tone mode allows users to tune their instrument by ear without relying on the screen.

The motor-assisted tuning feature also supports users with limited fine motor control by reducing the need for precise manual adjustments of the tuning pegs. By automating small tuning movements, the device can help make the tuning process more accessible and less physically demanding.

Together, these features aim to make the tuner usable by a wider range of players with varying sensory and motor abilities.
